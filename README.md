In this project I try to create a project of stock tracker app of different market place like Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft etc.. In here I'm use React.js

I'm use a third party module as a plot from react-plotly.js package using node package manager(npm) and use a stock API(www.alphavantage.co) and use fetch API to get response from the server....

In this project i'm getting a problem when i'm trying to push data in y axis but after a long time i finally solve the problem and complete the project

Thanks
